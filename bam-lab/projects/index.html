        <h4>BAM Lab Projects</h4>
        <p>In BAM Lab we work on projects focusing on advanced machine cognition from streaming and non-streaming big data (text, video, images, sensor, multimodal), knowledge management and provisioning cloud based information and knowledge services. We present our ongoing and past project work below under three sections: 
		<strong><a href="#data_analytics">data analytics</a></strong>, <strong><a href="#cognitive_computing">cognitive computing</a></strong> and 
		<strong><a href="#big_data">big data and cloud infrastructure</a></strong>. Many of our projects fall under more than one of these three areas. We develop solutions for real life problems by collaborating with our industry partners using advanced artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data processing, cloud data management and service provisioning techniques.</p>

			<h6>Measuring Biometric Data from Mobile Phone Video</h6>
			<p>In collaboration with
			<a href="https://markitech.ca/our-work-healthcare/">Markitech</a> 
			and <a href="https://yourdoctors.online/">YourDoctorsOnline</a> and 
			with Mitacs funding, BAM lab researchers developed a remote video 
			based biometric data measurement system (incorporated in the
			<a href="http://veyetals.com/">Veyetals</a> product) which uses 
			smart phone video to measure heart rate, heart rate variability, 
			oxygen saturation, stress level, blood pressure, and a separate 
			contactless sensor to measure body temperature. </p>
			<p><strong>Chat Analysis and Summarization</strong></p>
			<p>Chats offer challenges as these are often short responses, may 
			not be a complete sentence, can have a lot of noise (because of 
			machine voice to text translation or typing error), and have domain 
			specific terminology and phrases that are used in general 
			conversations. Our work on chat summarization focuses on medical 
			chats between real patients and real doctors over a medical advising 
			platform to summarize the past chats to assist the doctors with 
			providing an informed medical advice.</p>
			<p><strong>Hierarchical Classification of Images for Online Shopping 
			Market</strong></p>
			<p>In collaboration with a startup company, BAM lab researcher 
			(undergraduate) developed an efficient hierarchical image 
			classification algorithm to categorize clothing using camera for 
			online shopping market.</p>
			<h6>Identifying Reportable Diseases for Ministry of Health and Long Term Care</h6>
			<p>Created a cognitive data analytic and decision support pipeline for classifying noisy medical data based on schema and ministry specified guidelines using both a rule based and a neural network approach to identify reportable critical diseases [Lucas Rychlo].</p>
			<h6>A voice-controlled e-commerce application using IBM Watson</h6>
			<p>Reviewed state-of-the-art speech recognition systems, proposed a taxonomy and developed a speech enabled e-commerce website to increase accessibility of such websites using IBM Watson speech-to-text API and cloud services [Kandhari et al., 2018].</p>

			<h6>Autonomous Cars</h6>
			<p>Our CUTRIC funded project focuses on extracting key features from vehicular data for efficient V2V and V2I communication.
			<br>
			In an exploratory study, undergraduate students (Daisy Barrette and Alex Weatherhead) constructed two different versions of autonomous cars, one using ultrasonic sensors and deep learning models, and another using camera and deep convolutional networks, where the cars were trained to autonomously drive by sensing track boundaries. The model cars were made using raspberry pi with bluetooth connections, arduino uno  and commercially available cheap sensors. </p>

				<h6>Autonomous Car Tracking</h6>
                <p>Used evolutionary computing with feed forward neural network to train a vehicle to successfully navigate a track in the shortest time possible [Song et al., 2017]. The fitness criteria included successful completion of the track without hitting any walls at maximum speed.</p>

			<img src="../../assets/vehicle_detection.jpg" height="152" width="371" style="padding: 0 0 20px 20px; float: right">
			<p>In this project, we implemented two different deep learning models based on YOLO series algorithms and compared their performances in detecting vehicles such as cars and trucks for self-driving cars to ensure road safety. In detecting the vehicles within 50 meters, the two variations of our models, YOLO and YOLOv3, achieved 93.75% and 96.88% mean recall, and 82.50% and 97.92% F1-measure on a two-way road with a detection speed of 19 fps and 74 fps respectively.</p>
